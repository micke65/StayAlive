In my daily work from my home office, I often have some slack while downloading a database or waiting for other lengthy tasks to complete. 
Company policy is to automatically lock the computer after a few minutes of inactivity preventing me from see any incoming messages or when the task is done.

I created a tray application (WinForms) that:

•	Letting me override the company policy and select a custom time to wait before the computer locks, 
this is done by setting the computer in presentation mode for the specific time.

•	Letting me select if I would like this to happen regardless of my computer is in battery power mode or not.
